## A Little Bit About Myself
I was raised in Texas and I am proud to be a Texan. My background ranges from Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Phyiscs, and Mathematics. I am currently a Ph.D. student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I have my M.S. in Applied Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics as well as two B.S. degrees, one in Phyiscs and the other in Applied Mathematics. On my free time I love learning foreign languages such as Russian and Korean. I love to learn and continue to do so in all aspects. If you ever wanted to collobrate on a project, please contact me and we can go from there!

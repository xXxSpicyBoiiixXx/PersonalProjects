# Info

This is where I will put useful tools for pentesting. This will periodically be updated whenever I have time to fiddle and creating such tools. Feel free to let me know if there is something that doesn't work so may correct it. If there are any questions or concerns, please let me know. Always remember to go for the lowest hanging fruit with minimal detection!

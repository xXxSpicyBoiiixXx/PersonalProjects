Find an isomorphism of $G$, the group of all real numbers under $+$, onto $G'$, the group of all positive real numbers under multiplication. 
\end{problem}
 
\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be a group of real number with "$+$" as the operation. Let $G'$ be the group of positive real number with "$\times$" as the operation. We must find an isomorphism between $G$ and $G'$. \\ 

Let's suppose $\phi : G \rightarrow G'$ and $\phi (x) = e ^{x}$. This is clearly homomorphism due to the fact that \\
\centerline{$\phi (x+y) = e^{x+y} =e^x \cdot e^y = \phi (x) \phi (y)$} \\ \\
We can see that $e^{x}$ is one to one and onto, hence this is isomorphism. \\ \\
\centerline{\fbox{Hence, $e^{x}$ is an ismorphism between $G$ and $G'$}} \\ \\

\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{2.5.12}
Prove that if $Z(G)$ is the center of $G$, then $Z(G) \triangleleft G$. \\ 
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
We must show that the centre $Z(G)$ of a group $G$ is a normal subgroup $G$. \\ \\
The centre $Z(G) = \{ x \in G | xg = gx$ $\forall$ $g \in G$ is a subgroup of $G$. \\ \\
Let's suppose that $H = Z(G)$ and let $a \in G$ Then we must prove that $aH = Ha$. \\ \\
Let $p \in aH$ \\ \\
\centerline{$p = ah_1$ for some $h_1 \in H$ and $ah_1=h_1a$, since $h_1 \in Z(G)$} \\ \\
We then achieve that $aH \subset Ha$, now let $q \in Ha$ \\ \\
\centerline{$q = h_2a$ for some $h_2 \in H$ and $h_2a = ah_2$, since $h_2 \in Z(G)$} \\ \\
\centerline{$q \in Ha \rightarrow q \in aH$ then $Ha \subset aH$} \\ \\
\centerline{\fbox{Hence $aH = Ha$, $Z(G)$ is normal in $G$}} \\ \\
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{2.5.14}
If $G$ is abelian and $\phi: G \rightarrow G'$ is a homomorphism of $G$ onto $G'$, prove that $G'$ is abelian.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
We are given that $G$ and $G'$ are two groups and $\phi$ is an onto homomorphism of $\phi: G \rightarrow G'$. We must prove that if $G$ is abelian, then $G'$ is abelian. \\ \\
Let $a'$,$b'$ be two elements in $G'$.  \\
Since $\phi$ is an onto homomorphism there exist elements $a,b$ in $G$ such that \\ \\
\centerline{$\phi(a) = a'$ and $\phi(b) = b'$} \\ \\
\centerline{$a'b' = \phi (a) \phi (b) = \phi (ab) = \phi(ba) = \phi(b)\phi(a) = b'a'$} \\ \\
Hence for any elements $a'$,$b' \in G' \rightarrow a'b' = b'a'$ \\ \\
\centerline{\fbox{Hence, G' is ablian}} \\ \\
\end{proof}
 
 \begin{problem}{2.5.17}
If $M \triangleleft G, N \triangleleft G$, prove that $M \cup N \triangleleft G$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
We are given that $G$ is a group and $M,N$ are two normal subgroups of $G$. We must prove that $M \cap N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. \\ \\
We know that the intersection of two subgroups of $G$ is a subgroup of $G$. Hence, $M \cap N$ is a subgroup of $G$. We need to show that $M \cap N$ is normal in G. \\ \\
Let us consider $g \in G$ and $x \in M \cap N$ \\ \\
\centerline{$x \in M$ and $x \in N$} \\ \\
Since $M$ and $N$ is normal in $G$, we achieve \\ \\
\centerline{$x \in M,N$, $g\in G \rightarrow gxg^{-1}\in M,N$} \\ \\
This makes $gxg^{-1} \in M \cap N$ \\ \\
Hence $x\in M \cap N, g\in G \rightarrow gxg^{-1} \in M \cap N$. \\ \\
\centerline{\fbox{$M \cap N$ is normal in $G$.}} \\ \\
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}{2.5.3}
If $\phi$ is a homomorphism of $G$ into $G'$ , then the image of $\phi$ is a subgroup of $G'$ 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We can look at the definition, since this lemma prompts the definition that if $\phi$ is a homomorphism of $G$ into $G'$, then the kernal of $\phi$, $Ker \phi$, is defibned by $Ker \phi = \{ a \in G | \phi (a) = e' \}$. \\ \\
\end{proof}

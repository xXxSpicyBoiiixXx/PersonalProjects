  UPDATES:
  Version 1.0
  2014/10/05/1700>
              Re-formatted the code by creating functions for all
              the major operations. Removed the digital filter
              because all the filtering is done in hardware.
  Version 1.1
  2014/10/07:0435>
              Setting up code for the students to put in their
              data
  Version 1.2
  2014/10/07:0651>
              Added thresholding for pulse rate calculation. The
              calculation is determined by calculating the time
              between two peaks. This results in a good amount of
              variation from peak to peak.
              
              
  DESCRIPTION
  This code was written as an example for introduction to
  engineering students enrolled in the BME module of ES140 at
  Vanderbilt University.
  
  Uses an optical sensor (IR led, and photodiode) to detect pulse.
  The finger cuffs used are the ones available in the Vanderbilt
  University Instrumentation Lab. This version uses a simple
  transimpedance amplifier, high-pass filter, voltage divider to
  set-up a bias voltage and a simple gain stage for amplification.
  
  The codes reads the voltage from the circuit, which corresponds
  to the transmission of light through a person's finger. It then
  calculates the absorbance of the signal and outputs the data
  via serial communication. A corresponding LabVIEW VI reads the
  incoming serial data and plots it with time. The resulting
  waveform is the pulse waveform.
  
  The code also detects the time between pulses and uses the
  time between pulses to calculate pulse rate. This data is
  outputted via serial communication as well and is viewed in the
  corresponding LabVIEW VI.
  
  
  DISCLAIMER
  
  This code is in the public domain. Please feel free to modify,
  use, etc however you see fit. But, please give reference to
  original authors as a courtesy to Open Source developers.
